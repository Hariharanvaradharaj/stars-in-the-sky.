    <p id="para1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ONCE UPON A TIME a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters.  It was Cinderella who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire.  Cinderella who cooked the meals. Cinderella who kept the fire going. The poor girl could not stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.
        What a mess you are!” her two stepsisters laughed.  That is why they called her “Cinderella.”One day, big news was announced in their village.  It was time for the Prince to find a bride, and the King and Queen were going to have a ball!  All of the young ladies of the land were invited to come.  The stepsisters were wild with joy. They would wear their most beautiful gowns and fix their hair in the most splendid way. No doubt they would be the one to win the favor of the Prince!

        Cinderella now had extra work to do.  She had to sew two fabulous gowns for her step-sisters in the latest fashion. During the ball, the Prince felt despondent.  “Why do you have that sad look on your face?” the Queen said to her son.  “You would think you weren't at a royal ball your father and I are hosting just for you, so you can find a bride.”

        “I know you and Father are looking out for me,” said the Prince.  Yet something was wrong. He had already met most of the young women at the ball, and after he said “Hello,” there was nothing more to say.
        
        "Look!"  Someone pointed to the front door of the ballroom, at the top of the stairs.  
        
        All heads turned.  Who was that lovely maiden stepping down the stairs?  She held her head tall and stepped with grace and elegance. Who was she?  No one knew.
        Many things are possible,” said Cinderella, “if you wish them to be true.”

        "Do you really believe that?" said the Prince.

        "I know  it," said Cinderella. 

        The Prince felt a leap in his heart.  He and Cinderella danced. When the song was over, they danced again.  And then again. All the time they were talking and laughing.  Soon the other maidens at the ball grew jealous.  “Why is he staying dance after dance with HER?” they said. “Give someone else a chance.  How rude!”
        He looked around but could not see her blue dress anywhere.  “This is all I have left from her,” he said, looking down forlornly at the glass slipper.  He noticed that it was made in a special way, to fit a foot like none other. “Somewhere that young maiden has the other glass slipper,” he said.  “I will find her, and when I do, I will ask her to be my bride!”
        “Hush!” hissed the stepmother.  “He'll hear you!  Now get ready. One of you must fit your foot in that slipper, no matter what it takes!”  The stepmother swirled around to face Cinderella.  "Get out of my sight," she glowered, "Go to your room right now and stay there!"

       The Prince knocked.  The stepmother flew open the door.  “Come in!” she said in a sweet, sultry voice. “I have two lovely daughters you must see.”
